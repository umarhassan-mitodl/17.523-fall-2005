First Essay Assignment:
-----------------------

Students are expected to write a 5-7 page, double-spaced essay in response to one of three questions. In these essays, they are expected to refer to at least two of the assigned readings. Outside sources (e.g. web sources, journal articles, newspaper articles, books) are encouraged, but not necessary.

The three essay questions require students to critically analyze key arguments emerging from the readings. The first question asks students to decide whether the current debates among natural scientists and anthropologists are relevant to the social scientific study of racial politics and to the lives of average citizens. The second question asks students to compare and contrast different views about the nature of ethnicity and ethnic identity offered in the readings. The third question asks students to consider whether and how historical claims of “peoplehood” and land matter to contemporary nationalist movements.
